## This is a very simple solution to the FizzBuzz problem using Java.

*What is FizzBuzz?*

Write a program that prints the integers from 1 to 100(inclusive).


But:

  for multiples of three, print   *Fizz*     (instead of the number)
  for multiples of five, print   *Buzz*     (instead of the number)
  for multiples of both three and five, print   *FizzBuzz*     (instead of the number)


Solution is just a couple of simple conditional statements
